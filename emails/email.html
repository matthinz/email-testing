      <h2>About the United States Department of Ice Cream</h2>

      <p>
        The United States Department of Ice Cream was established in the early
        1800s in response to the demand for frozen desserts from the burgeoning
        population. The first ice cream recipes were created by Thomas Jefferson
        and George Washington in the late 1700s, and the popularity of these
        recipes quickly spread across the country. The Department of Ice Cream
        was founded to ensure that these recipes and the quality of the frozen
        treats remained consistent and safe for consumption. The Department
        quickly grew in size and scope, eventually adding a research and
        development division to innovate new flavors and techniques for making
        and serving ice cream. The Department also worked to ensure the safety
        of ice cream production, setting standards for cleanliness and hygiene
        in ice cream factories. Today, the Department of Ice Cream remains a
        vital part of the US food system, providing oversight and regulation to
        ensure the quality and safety of ice cream production and consumption.
