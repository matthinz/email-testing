        <h2>About the United States Department of Ice Cream</h2>

        <p>
          The United States Department of Ice Cream was established in the early
          1800s in response to the demand for frozen desserts from the
          burgeoning population. The first ice cream recipes were created by
          Thomas Jefferson and George Washington in the late 1700s, and the
          popularity of these recipes quickly spread across the country. The
          Department of Ice Cream was founded to ensure that these recipes and
          the quality of the frozen treats remained consistent and safe for
          consumption. The Department quickly grew in size and scope, eventually
          adding a research and development division to innovate new flavors and
          techniques for making and serving ice cream. The Department also
          worked to ensure the safety of ice cream production, setting standards
          for cleanliness and hygiene in ice cream factories. Today, the
          Department of Ice Cream remains a vital part of the US food system,
          providing oversight and regulation to ensure the quality and safety of
          ice cream production and consumption.
